									<h1> Vector Analysis - Areas of interest for moving in Hamburg</h1>

										<h2>About the data</h2>
									</header>
									<p>The datasets correspond, in the majority, to Hamburg. They were downloaded from the ESRI Deutschland Open
										Data Portal. There is a data set corresponding to the municipalities of all Germany, used to set Hamburg
										in context. A dataset containing the city divisions in Hamburg was used to delineate the area of study.
										Additionally, there is a line data set used for the bike routes and two point data sets corresponding to
										the public transport stations and park locations.</p>
									<header>
										<h2>The Processing</h2>
									</header>
									<p>The processing was done using ModelBuilder. Moreover, Buffers were created to establish distances according
										to how much I was willing to move to get to the desired destination. 500 meters for parks, 1000 m for
										public transportation stations, and 1000 m for bike routes, since I can reach the latter by cycling. These
										Buffers were then intersected to discriminate interesting areas.</p>

									</header>
									<p>The results show a group of zones in the central area of the city. However, there are a couple of areas of
										interest on the south side of the city. The main conclusion being that the best zone to look for a place 
										to move in would be in the middle of the city. There was an additional analysis. There is a dataset
										available with all the addresses in the city, which contains 276,411 addresses. After having the zones of
										interest polygon, I applied an intersection with this addresses dataset, I obtained 9390 interesting addresses.
										To me, this is a good example of how to filter data by using spatial analysis.</p>
